“Evaluation of drought definitions in scientific publications using automated information retrieval:  An examination of the methodology and accuracy of scientific publications in forested areas on drought”

All my code for the automatic information extraction, as well as the re-analysis of the drought definitions will be uploaded and managed here.

How to execute:
1. Download Docker Image from Dockerhub: Link
2. Start the Image using Docker Desktop
3. Download the updated Excel file from the created Volume in Docker Desktop (maybe implement direct output in the excel_processing.py script)
