This is the repository for my bachelor thesis “Evaluation of drought definitions in scientific publications using automated information retrieval:  An examination of the methodology and accuracy of scientific publications in forested areas on drought”

All my code for the automatic information extraction, as well as the re-analysis of the drought condition will be uploaded and managed here.
